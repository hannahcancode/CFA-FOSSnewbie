# FOSSnewbie

## About

I wanted to search projects on GitHub by language to find issues that are labelled as suitable for first time contributors to Free and Open Source (FOSS).

FOSSnewbie is a node terminal app that takes user input for issue tag and language, and then uses the GitHub API to search issues that match.

This is my first node project!

## Installation

- Clone this repository
- run `$ npm install` to install the modules from the package.json
- run `$ node index.js` and follow the prompts

## To do
- Check user input is a valid number
- Allow user to input other query terms
- Add defaults (e.g. 'first-timers-only')
